Assignment – Calculate Maximum Temperature

Introduction

Apply your MapReduce programming knowledge and write a MapReduce program to
process a dataset with multiple temperatures for a year. You need to process the dataset to
find out the maximum temperature for each year in the dataset.

Problem statement

Let’s understand the problem through a subset of temperature records as shown:

1900	36
1900	29
1901	32
1901	40
1901	29
1901	48
1901	16
1901	11
1901	21
1901	6
1901	22
1902	49
1902	49

In this data set, the first field represents the year and the second field represents the temperature in
that year. As the temperature will not be constant throughout the year, each year has multiple
temperatures listed in the dataset. You need to process the dataset and find the maximum
temperature during a year. Here is the sample output:

Sample Output
Year Maximum Temperature
1900 36
1901 48
1902 49

Your task in this assignment is to process the ‘temperature’ records using MapReduce program and
find out the maximum temperature during each year in this dataset.
