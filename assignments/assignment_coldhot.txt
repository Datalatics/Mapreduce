Assignment – Find the Hot and Cold Days

Introduction:
Apply your MapReduce programming knowledge and write a MapReduce program to process a dataset with temperature records. You need to find the Hot and Cold days in a
year based on the maximum and minimum temperatures on those days.

The dataset for this problem is the ‘WeatherData’ records file available in Git. This dataset has been taken from National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) public datasets. 
You can download more datasets from this FTP site ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/uscrn/products/daily01/ and review the README file to understand the available datasets.

Problem statement:

Your task is to find out the dates with maximum temperature greater than 40 (A Hot Day) and minimum temperature lower than 10 (A Cold Day).
