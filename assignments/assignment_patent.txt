Assignment – Calculate the number of sub-patents

Introduction

Apply your MapReduce programming knowledge and write a MapReduce program to
process a dataset with patent records. You need to calculate the number of sub-patents
associated with each patent.


Problem statement

Let’s understand the problem through a subset of patent records as shown in the following figure:

Each patent has sub-patent id’s associated with it. You need to calculate the number of sub-patent
associated with each patent. Here is the sample output:

Sample Output
Patent Number of Associated Sub-patents
1 13
2 10
3 4

Your task in this assignment is to process the ‘patent’ records using MapReduce program and count
the number of associated sub-patents for each patent is in this dataset.
